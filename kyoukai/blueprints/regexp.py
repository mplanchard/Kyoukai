    RegexBlueprints are very simple compared to other types of blueprints, using a basic regular expression to match
    the path of of a request with a route. This means there is no complex type conversion, as there is with
    :class:`kyoukai.blueprints.wz.WerkzeugBlueprint`, and the routes used can be incredibly powerful.
