    A Blueprint is a container for routes.

    Blueprints have 'parent' blueprints - they inherit error handlers and hooks from them. The root blueprint has no
    parent, so it does not inherit from anything.
    Note that if a Blueprint that is not the root blueprint has a parent value of None, it is automatically set to
    inherit the root blueprint of the app.

    Blueprints allow routes like normal application objects - in fact, the application object's route function is
    implemented with an underlying root blueprint.
